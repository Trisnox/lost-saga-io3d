title: Importing Animation
---

In order to import animation, you need to import skeleton first (using advanced), then animation. Mesh is optional.

## Importing Skeleton
Either go to `File > Import > Lost Saga Skeleton (.skl)`, or through the n-panel, inside SKL/MSH panel, using the [`Import Skeleton`](../SKL%20MSH%20Panel/skeleton_import.md) button. After this, choose `normal.skl`, make sure the mode is set to `Advanced` (display choice doesn't matter), and then import them.

## Importing Animation
In the [`Animation Entry`](../ANI%20Panel/animation_entry.md) panel, click the [`Import`](../ANI%20Panel/animation_entry.md#entry-import) button. After animation has been appended to entry, select the entry you want to insert, select armature/bone, and then click the [`Apply Animation`](../ANI%20Panel/animation_entry.md#apply-animation) button

## Attaching Mesh
In the outliner, there is `mesh_armature` object, use that object to attach meshes with.
