!!! warning "Note"

    This guide does not teach you how to use Blender, this guide assumes that you already have basic knowledge of blender, this wiki only explain the usage of the add-on. You might need to [learn basics of Blender](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=blender+tutorial) if you want to use this add-on.

    Do not ask support about usage of Blender either, I will only answer support regarding the add-on. There exist [community for Blender](https://discord.com/invite/blender) though, you can ask for help regarding Blender there, there is also beginner guide on pinned messages.

    For support about this add-on, you can ask at my [Discord server](https://discord.gg/dJUMU9Gkw2).
