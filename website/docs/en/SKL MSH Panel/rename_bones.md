## Rename Bones
Rename all bones into [something Blender can recognize](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/animation/armatures/bones/editing/naming.html), or vice versa.

Renaming bones will also rename the vertex group on all attached meshes, which can be helpful to automatically symmetrize weight painting, or to mirror bone position/rotation, just make sure to attach them first before renaming.

It is not recommended to rename advanced bones since animation are name dependant.
