## Attach Armature
One click solution to attach all selected meshes with the target armature.

Just simply select all mesh you want to attach armature, and then the target armature, the order does not matter as it will automatically uses the first armature it finds.

If you're using advanced skeleton, you would need to use the `mesh_armature` instead, make sure to unhide it to be able to select them in viewport.
