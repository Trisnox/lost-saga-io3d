# How to Install Add-on
**Make sure your [Blender](https://www.blender.org/download/) version is 4.1 or above**

Download the latest release from github. Link [https://github.com/Trisnox/lost-saga-io3d/releases](https://github.com/Trisnox/lost-saga-io3d/releases), choose `Source Code (zip)`.

After you've downloaded the files, you can either:

- Drag and drop the `.zip` file into the Blender window, and then confirm
- Install add-on through `Edit > Preferences > Add-on > Install from disk`. Make sure to enable add-on if you haven't.

After add-on is installed, io3d panel will appear at 3d viewport
