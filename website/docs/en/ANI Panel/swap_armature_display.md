This operator is only for advanced skeleton only.

## Swap Armature Display
Swap armature display between empty and armature.

!!! warning "Warning"
    Swapping armature display does not carry over existing pose or animation. However, they still retain their data. You can use [`bake action`](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/editors/nla/editing/strip.html#bpy-ops-nla-bake) to transfer animation data since both display constraints each other.
